  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Hello, my name is Vitalii and I'm an engineer. Sounds simple. But having overall more than 10 years of commercial experience
    in software development industry I wouldn't designate myself to a single role as a developer, engineer or manager.
     I like to be engaged in different kinds of activity in creating something digital, modern and complex.

    Mainly I've been working on research, design, and programming of new web applications and REST API's.
    I know what code refactoring is and how to do it properly. I've integrated a lot 3rd party API's and know all pain
    in using something which was written hundreds of years ago. I like testing and do not hate bug fixing.
    Also, I have some experience in DevOps and I'm not afraid of Unix. My strong personal qualities are analytical thinking,
    fluent communication, and problem-solving skills.
