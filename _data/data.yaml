  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Hello, my name is Vitalii and I'm an engineer. Sounds simple. But having overall more than 10 years of commercial experience
    in the software development industry, I wouldn't designate myself to a single role as a developer, engineer or manager.
    I like being engaged in different activities during creating something digital, modern and complex.

    Mainly I've been working on research, design, and programming of new web applications and REST API's.
    I know what code refactoring is and how to do it properly. I've integrated a lot 3rd party API's and know all the pain
    in using something which was written hundreds of years ago. I like writing tests and I don't hesitate to do bug-fixing.
    Besides that, I have experience in team leadership and some experience in DevOps. My strong personal qualities are analytical thinking,
    fluent communication, and problem-solving skills.
